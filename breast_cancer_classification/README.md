# Breast Cancer Classification

## Introduction
This project focuses on classifying breast cancer using machine learning models. The classification is based on features extracted from breast cancer datasets, and models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of breast cancer data with various features representing tumor characteristics. The data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Models Used
The following machine learning models are implemented:
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Decision Tree (DT)**
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB)**
- **Random Forest (RF)**
- **Logistic Regression (LR)**

## Requirements
To run this project, install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook breast_cancer_classification.ipynb
   ```
2. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

## Results
The models are evaluated based on:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
